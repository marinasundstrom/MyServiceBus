# Porting Checklist for MyServiceBus

- **Confirm prerequisites**: Ensure build tools, package managers, and a compatible runtime exist for the target platform.
- **Understand repository architecture**: Study the existing C# and Java clients to learn message flows and core abstractions.
- **Assess feature parity**: Catalog current features (serialization, routing, retries, telemetry) and determine how to provide them on the new platform.
- **Provision infrastructure**: Configure a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) or an in-memory transport appropriate for the platform.
- **Port core messaging features**: Implement publish/subscribe and request/response patterns, retries, and metrics in a way that fits platform conventions.
- **Handle errors**: Replicate or adapt error-handling semantics as needed; checked exception support can be deferred.
- **Integrate logging**: Use the platform's standard logging abstraction and ensure consumer failures are logged instead of crashing the process.
- **Establish CI**: Set up a continuous integration pipeline to build the new client, run its tests, and enforce formatting.
- **Document and validate**: Update the quick start guide and feature walkthrough and add tests mirroring existing ones to verify feature parity.
