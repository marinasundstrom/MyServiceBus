# MyServiceBus Design Goals

- **MassTransit Familiarity in C#**: Developers coming from MassTransit should find the C# client familiar in its design and concepts.
- **Cross-Language Parity**: Moving between the C# and Java clients should require minimal adjustment; the API and behavior should remain consistent once language-specific design choices are accounted for.
- **Aligned Implementations**: The C# and Java codebases, including their test harnesses, should evolve together so that features and behavior stay in sync.

See the [design philosophy](design-philosophy.md) for how these goals shape cross-platform APIs and configuration.
