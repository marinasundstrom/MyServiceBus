# Why Choose MyServiceBus for Java

MyServiceBus brings a MassTransit-compatible message bus to the JVM with a focus on
cross-language interoperability and minimal dependencies. Consider MyServiceBus when you need:

- **Cross-platform services** – run C# and Java consumers side-by-side while sharing contracts and transports.
- **Lightweight runtime** – the Java client relies only on small DI and logging abstractions, keeping deployments slim.
- **Familiar concepts** – MassTransit experience transfers directly; configuration and messaging patterns mirror the .NET world.
- **Configurable retries** – opt into retry policies through filters to handle transient failures.
- **Explicit control** – applications start and stop the bus manually, providing deterministic lifecycle management.

These characteristics make MyServiceBus a pragmatic option for Java teams integrating with existing MassTransit ecosystems or
introducing a unified bus across languages.
