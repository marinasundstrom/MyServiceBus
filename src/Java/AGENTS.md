# AGENTS Instructions

This directory contains the Java implementation of MyServiceBus. See `../../docs/development/design-guidelines.md` for architectural and feature parity guidelines.

## Code style
- Use standard Java conventions (UpperCamelCase for classes and interfaces, lowerCamelCase for methods and variables).
- Format code using your IDE's auto-format.

## Testing
- Run `gradle test` from the repository root and ensure all tests pass before committing.
- Use the system `gradle` rather than the checked-in Gradle wrapper.
